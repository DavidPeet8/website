				Hi, I'm {{ data.name }}! Thanks for visiting my website!
				<br/><br/>
				I am a {{ data.schoolTerm }} Honours Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My passion lies in software development, especially low level languages like C++, although I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, and Bash as well. My main interests are in Operating Systems development as well as Compiler & Interpreter development. I prioritize well structured, documented code that emphasizes both time and space efficiency. I am always eager to learn new concepts and technologies. Currently Golang is at the top of my list of exciting technologies to learn. Golang excites me due to its unique design (not a derivative of C).  It offers unrivaled performance among languages and includes a garbage collector.
				<br/><br/>
				I'm <b>Looking for {{ data.internshipDate }} internship opportunities!</b> Please reach out through email or LinkedIn if you feel that I would be a good fit on your team!
