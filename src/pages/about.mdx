# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David!

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Last term, I was working at Huawei on lightweight cryptography.
I'm interested in systems development including OS and compiler development as well as backend web development, and I'm always interested in learning!

I'm looking for Fall 2022 (Sept-Dec) internship opportunities! Feel free to reach out through [email - (dapeet@uwaterloo.ca)](mailto:dapeet@uwaterloo.ca) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dapeet/) to chat!
