Although impractical for *binary patching*, Binary IO is a useful tool for understanding binary formats and investigating small non human readable files. I created Binary IO in my spare time while working at Huawei to assist me in understanding the compiler object file format used.

What I wanted to create with this project was a tool to give me true insight into file content. I wanted to remove endian conversions and other magic that mainstream tools apply automatically for usability improvements, and instead provide a tool that *"tells it like it is"*. I found this particularly useful for understanding & generating binary file formats.
