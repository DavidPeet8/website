Human experiences lend themselves to storage in a graph style data-structure. Unfortunately such a graph is difficult to construct and even more difficult to maintain as references between nodes must be updated so frequently.

I wrote note modules (... `node_modules` ... haha see what I did there?) to obtain some of the benefits of a graph storage of knowledge. This includes improved modularization of notes as well as prevention of data duplication. In all, Note Modules provides:
- A preprocessing stage to remove questionable semantic choices in the markdown specification
- Latex Math rendering
- Note composition - view the content of one note inline inside of another
- Versioning / source control
