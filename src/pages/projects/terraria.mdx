This Terraria emulation was a summative project I developed in highschool which inadvertently became a passive aggressive attack on Windows.

**Cool Features:**
1. Random terrain distribution via a pseudorandom noise algorithm derived from *Perlin Noise*
2. Random resource distribution via the same noise function
3. Supports basic game mechanics including movement & physics, mining & tools, and inventory & storage
