At McAfee I worked on the *Installer team*. My team was concerned with all product installers but particularly with the main *Windows System Security* installer.

Over the term I worked to improve the performance and reliability of our core product installer. I removed unnecessary forced device reboots throughout the install process. I also profiled the install process via binary instrumentation to isolate install time bottlenecks.
