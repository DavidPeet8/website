Axonify's product is an employee training service targeting frontline employees for organizations. Essentially the app provides an initial onboarding experience for new employees to get them up to speed called *Guided Learning*, as well as an ongoing ML based training regimen for employees to keep fresh on their training knowledge. In addition to the benefit to frontline employees, the service also provides a variety of metrics on training completion to upper management.

At Axonify I worked on the Guided Learning team developing a new feature for our app's onboarding flow. I worked on developing *Milestones* - a feature intended to act like checkpoints giving trainees something to strive for while progressing through their onboarding tasks.
