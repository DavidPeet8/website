The idea behind this project was to enable dynamic cluster configuration in Sched. Sched consists of an orchestration node and a compute cluster. The sched orchestrator obtains cluster configuration from a CSV file. This file indicates what hosts are available, how to access them, and their specifications. With the advent of a Netbox library, each host can advertise its presence to the orchestrator, allowing Sched to decide what hosts to add to the compute cluster and when. In other words, sched can scale the cluster size based on the current load."),(0,a.mdx)("p",null,(0,a.mdx)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Improved Log Searching:"),' The second project I worked on was implementing binary search by timestamp in log files. This project was pretty straightforward but had a couple of interesting points. First, the search needs to be performed on the caching layer, so system calls cannot be used (they would blow through the caching layer and hit the underlying filesystem). Second, log entries are not uniform in size. As a result, it is impossible to find the "middle" element by index. I addressed these issues with ',(0,a.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"boundless binary search")," and ",(0,a.mdx)("em",{parentName:"p"},"algorithm selection")," respectively."),(0,a.mdx)("p",null,(0,a.mdx)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Compression at Rest within Sched:")," The final project I worked on in my first rotation was compression at rest within sched orchestration nodes. After a developer sends a job to sched, the job context is queued on the orchestration node. From here, the orchestration node will dispatch the enqueued jobs to the compute cluster for evaluation. The issue here is what happens if multiple jobs are submitted that share a lot of common data - say an 800MB Pandas data frame? Currently, such a  data frame would be stored once with each job submitted to sched. As a result, submitting large jobs that share data can quickly exhaust machine resources. To prevent this, I implemented a compressor based on the LZW algorithm using an external codebook. The choice of external codebook allows the codebook to persist across runs of the compressor, and thus compress data replicated across enqueued jobs."),(0,a.mdx)("h1",null,"Acceleration"),(0,a.mdx)("p",null,"During my second rotation, I worked with the Acceleration team, responsible for developing tools that make algorithm developers (those that create trading strategies) faster & more effective.
